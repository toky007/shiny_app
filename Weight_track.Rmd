## Weight track app
the weight track is an app made to evaluate the body mass index (BMI) of a person to identify if its weight is normal or not.

## Input
To calculate the BMI, those informations are useful:
1. **Height** of the person in meter
2. **Weight** of the person in kg


## Output
To calculate the BMI, the next formula is used 
BMI <- weight/height^2
Let's get some example
```{r, echo = TRUE}
height <- 1.7;weight <- 80;BMI <- weight/height^2
BMI
```
The second output indicate the person' state. The next dataframe displays it.
```{r}
bmi_class <- data.frame(c("-19","19-24","25-29","30-39","+40"), c("too thin","normal weighted","overweighted","obese","super obese"))
names(bmi_class) <- c("BMI", "State")
bmi_class
```
## Thank you
